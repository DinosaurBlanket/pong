This is a recreation of the classic videogame, Pong, built entirely with open web standards.
Control the paddle on the right by hovering your cursor over the game.

The left Paddle is controlled by the computer.
The speed of the ball increses with each paddle hit.
You can affect the angle of the ball's deflection by hitting the ball higher or lower on the paddle. 
If you hit the ball with a higher portion of the paddle, the ball will be deflected more upwards, and 
if you hit the ball with a lower portion of the paddle, the ball will be deflected more downwards. 
If the ball hits direclty in the middle of the paddle, it will bounce off the paddle just as it would bounce off of a flat wall.
This applies to the computer's paddle also.

The computer is very good at knowing where the ball will be, but it can only move the paddle so fast. 
Therefore, a good strategy is to hit the ball into one one corner, 
then the opposite corner so that the computer will not be able to reach it in time.
